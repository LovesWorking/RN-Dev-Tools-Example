## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ Real-time React Query state monitoring
- üíæ **Device storage monitoring with CRUD operations** - MMKV, AsyncStorage, and SecureStorage
- üåê **Environment variables monitoring** - View and track public environment variables
- üé® Beautiful native macOS interface
- üöÄ Automatic connection to React apps
- üìä Query status visualization
- üîå Socket.IO integration for reliable communication
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Simple setup with NPM package
- üì± Works with **any React-based platform**: React Native, React Web, Next.js, Expo, tvOS, VR, etc.
- üõë Zero-config production safety - automatically disabled in production builds

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Download and launch the [React Native DevTools](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools) desktop app
5. The app will automatically connect and sync React Query state, storage, and environment variables

## üíæ Storage Demo

This example app demonstrates real-time storage monitoring with:

- **Mock MMKV Storage**: High-performance key-value storage simulation (using AsyncStorage for Expo Go compatibility)
- **AsyncStorage**: React Native's standard async storage
- **SecureStore**: Secure storage for sensitive data (Expo SecureStore)

### Features Demonstrated

- **Real-time monitoring**: See storage changes as they happen in DevTools
- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, and delete storage entries directly from the app
- **React Query integration**: Access storage data via queries like `['#storage', 'mmkv', 'keyName']`
- **Type-safe operations**: Automatic serialization/deserialization of complex data types
- **Expo Go compatibility**: Mock MMKV implementation that works with Expo Go

> **Note**: This demo uses a mock MMKV implementation for Expo Go compatibility. In a real development build or production app, you would use the actual [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) package for better performance.

## üåê Environment Variables Demo

The app showcases environment variable monitoring with:

- **Public variables**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables visible to the client
- **Private variables**: Server-side only variables for development
- **Real-time sync**: Environment variables are automatically synced with DevTools
- **Visual indicators**: Clear distinction between public and private variables

### Example Environment Variables

```bash
# Public variables (visible in client)
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=RN DevTools Example
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE=true

# Private variables (development only)
NODE_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=demo-secret-key-not-for-production
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://demo.db
```
